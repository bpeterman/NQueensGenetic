NQueensGenetic
==============
This solves the N-Queens Problem using a genetic algorithm.  The code generates a series of random
integers to represent chromosomes.  Then assigns a fitness function to these chromosomes.  Ranks the 
chromosomes based on fitness.  The most fit perform a crossover with each other.  The system also allows
for random mutations to occur.

This is not a very efficient algorithm for solving this problem.
